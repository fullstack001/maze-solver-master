# Maze Solver

This little project was developed as a way of learning python. It is a GUI application that will generate a Maze using a recursive backtracking algorithm, and then attempt to solve the created maze. 

**To run this project...**

Install the required python dependencies. This project requires tkinter which should be pre bundled with python 3.1. It wasn't for me though so wft to that I guess, so just be aware. 

To run the project: `python -m maze_solver` should do the trick. If not the `__main__.py` file is the one you should run.
